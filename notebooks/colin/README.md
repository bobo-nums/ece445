# 2022-02-07 - Meeting for Project Proposal
We met to discuss the inner workings of the project proposal.  Specific attention was paid to the parts (i.e. sensors) and the block diagram, which Richard and I developed.  Progress is still needed for both of these components before finalizing the proposal by Thursday, 02/10.

# 2022-02-08 - First Meeting with Qingyu
Today we met with Qingyu for the first time to discuss where our project is at right now.  We will shift our focus to a few key details as we finish the project proposal:
1. Planning how we will demonstrate the various functions of the traffic light
2. Adding details to block diagram (i.e. sensor protocols and specific parts)
3. Contacting TA Evan Widloski and Professors Schuh and Banerjee about the power switching component of our design
    * LTC4412 - OR'ing of multiple power sources ([datasheet](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/4412fb.pdf "LTC4412"))
    * Power MUX
    * Possibility of manual switch (worst case scenario)

I will email the people listed above for advice about which strategy to use, while in the search of new ideas.
