# Project Proposal Meeting (2/7/22)
The goal of this session was to meet and discuss the requirements of our traffic light system and how everything would connect generally. Tomorrow we are meeting with our TA for the first time and we will get their opinion on what we come up with today. Prior to meeting I created the intial version of our visual aid diagram (see figure 1). After discussing the subsystems and components of our system I created the first version of our block diagram (see figure 2). There is missing details which will likely need to be added in the future (communication protocols between the sensors and the MCU, etc.). We briefly talked about parts we could use, we will make a more definitive list after ironing out some finer details.

#First TA Meeting (2/8/22)
Today we had our first meeting with our TA, Qingyu. We discussed the project proposal and what our design looks like so far far for the project. 
The main points Qingyu made were that we should think about how we will demonstrate our project considering the solar panel will need to be in the sun. Qingyu also urged
us to get together a parts list and design our pcb as soon as possible so we can order them and ensure we have everything put together in time to demo. We also took a look at
the block diagram and Qingyu confirmed it was lacking in detail and we will need to update it in the future.
