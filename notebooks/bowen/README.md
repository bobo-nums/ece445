# Bowen Worklog
## 2/7/22 - Work on proposal
We met and worked on our project proposal. We found some components that could work for our sensors. 

- SEN-18364 humidity and temperature sensor
    - 2.2V - 5.5V
    - I2C communication
    - op. temp: -40&deg;C to 80&deg;C
- GP2Y0A21YK0F IR sensor
    - 4.5V - 5.5V
    - 30mA operating current
    - op. temp: -10&deg;C to 60&deg;C

We also researched how to smoothly switch between two different power sources and found something called a power mux. However, none of the components could support a 24V input, so we might need to find something else, or switch to 12V LEDs.
